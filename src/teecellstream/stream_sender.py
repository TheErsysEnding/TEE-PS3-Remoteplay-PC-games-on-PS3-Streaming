"""Fragments one H.264 access unit into paced UDP packets, and splits a live Annex-B pipe into access units.

Port of StreamSender.cs (send_access_unit) and of LiveAnnexBSplitter from LiveStreamer.cs (AnnexBSplitter).

fragment packet layout (20-byte header, big-endian, must match stream.c on the PS3):
  [0]='V' [1]='F' [2..5]=frameId [6..7]=fragIndex [8..9]=fragCount [10]=flags(bit0 keyframe)
  [11]=version [12..19]=encoder-exit time (server microseconds, for latency measurement)
every fragment except a frame's last carries exactly FRAGMENT_PAYLOAD_BYTES of data - the PS3 places
fragment i at i * FRAGMENT_PAYLOAD_BYTES and sizes the frame off the last fragment alone.

# incremental Annex-B access-unit splitter for a live pipe: push encoder bytes in, take complete access
# units out. parameter units (SPS/PPS/SEI) attach to the picture that follows; a picture unit closes the
# unit, and the unit ends where the next unit's first NAL begins - so a unit only comes out once the
# encoder has begun the next one (a live pipe never needs the last one; flush() exists for files/tests).
#
# "the next unit's first NAL" is the part that needs care once a picture may hold more than ONE slice.
# H.264 numbers every slice by the macroblock it starts at, and only the first slice of a picture starts
# at 0. That number is first_mb_in_slice, the very first syntax element of the slice header, coded as
# exp-Golomb - and exp-Golomb writes the value 0 as the single bit 1. So "is this slice the start of a new
# picture" is one bit test on the byte after the NAL header, and nothing has to be parsed.
#
# Without that test every slice after the first would look like the beginning of the next picture, and a
# 4-slice picture would leave here as 4 access units with 4 frame ids. The console would then be handed
# quarter-pictures as if they were whole ones - which is what happened, and what made the 1.12.1 verdict on
# slices worthless. Re-measured with this fixed: slices really are worse, but by a factor and for a reason
# nobody knew before (protocol.SLICE_COUNTS). The framing has to be right either way.
#
# start codes are found with bytes.find (C speed): at 10Mbit/s that is ~1000 NALs a second, and walking
# the buffer byte by byte in Python was measured far too slow to keep up with the encoder.
