"""Holds the display on and the PC awake while streaming (port of Server.keepDisplayAwake).

Capturing a slept display returns black frames, so an inhibit is held WHILE streaming; when idle it is
released so the screen sleeps normally. Windows used SetThreadExecutionState; here it is the GNOME
session manager's Inhibit (idle + suspend), or the freedesktop screensaver one where that is what runs.
The inhibit dies with our bus connection, so a crash can never leave the screen stuck on.
