"""The live sender: captures the desktop, encodes it with a spawned ffmpeg, reads the raw Annex-B stream
from its output pipe, splits it into access units incrementally, and sends each one to the PS3 as it
comes out of the encoder (port of LiveStreamer.cs).

Windows fed ffmpeg from ddagrab inside the same command line. Here the capture is an object of its own
(capture.py: Portal/PipeWire, x11grab, or a test pattern): it is started before ffmpeg, and the raw-pipe
backends write their frames into ffmpeg's stdin from a feed thread while this module reads ffmpeg's stdout.

Tries each encoder the PC has in turn (the chosen one first) and falls back down the ladder; all of them
failing three times running trips the server's fuse instead of retrying forever - retrying flapped the
desktop resolution on and off and made the PC unusable.
