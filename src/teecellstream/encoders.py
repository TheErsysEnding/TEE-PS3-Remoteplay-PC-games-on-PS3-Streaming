"""Which H.264 encoders this PC can run, and the ffmpeg command line for each.

Port of VideoEncoders.cs plus the Build*Arguments half of LiveStreamer.cs. The Windows ladder was
Quick Sync, nvenc, amf, x264 with ddagrab capture baked into every command line; on Linux the capture
is a separate concern (capture.py hands us its input arguments) and the hardware rungs are nvenc and
VA-API (Intel and AMD alike), then x264 on the CPU.

Which of them this PC can actually run is found out once, at start-up, by asking each to encode a single
frame - a machine with no NVIDIA card should never be offered nvenc, let alone waste a second failing it.

# black frames with a white marker once a second, 10 markers, two runs each): the marker's AU begins to
# leave ffmpeg 34.8 ms after the marker frame was written without it, 2.3 ms with `-delay 0` (the whole

# frame's start code). Output identical either way: 690/690 frames, the same byte count, one IDR, decodes
# clean. Two frames of latency for nothing, so it is on.
