# The stream size. 1280x720 is the original's, and for a long time the only one anyone had measured on a
# console. The larger ones exist because CAVLC turned out to leave headroom: on the real PS3, CAVLC at
# 17 Mbit/s decoded in 22 ms per picture where CABAC at the same rate needed 36-40. More pixels cost the
# SPU decoder roughly in proportion, so these are an experiment and not a recommendation - upstream measured
# 1080p at 80-120 ms and 27 fps, though with CABAC (upstream/ps3-app/README.md). The PS3 sizes its decoder
# from the stream's own SPS and letterboxes whatever it gets, so nothing on that side has to be told.
# Every one of these is a multiple of 16 in both directions. H.264 codes in 16x16
# macroblocks, so a height like 900 or 1080 is rounded UP (to 912 / 1088) and the encoder adds a cropping
# note for the display size. The PS3 ignores that note and takes the coded size - the console showed
# "1600x912" and "1920x1088" - so a misaligned size costs decode time for rows nobody wants to see and
# stretches the picture (1600x912 is 1.754, not 1.778). These sizes have neither problem.
# Three of them are exactly 16:9; 1408x800 is 1.760, because an exact 16:9 that is also macroblock-aligned
# needs a height divisible by 144 and there is none between 720 and 864. 0.9% off, and the PS3 letterboxes
# to the TV anyway.
# 1920x1088 rather than 1920x1080: 1080 is not a multiple of 16, so H.264 must code 1088 rows and mark
# the extra 8 as cropped - and the PS3 app never reads the cropping fields (h264.c derives its size from
# pic_width_in_mbs / pic_height_in_map_units alone, deliberately, because cellVdec must be given the CODED
# size). A 1080 stream therefore appears as 1088 on the console anyway, with 8 rows of encoder padding on
# screen and the picture squashed by that much. Sending 1088 real rows costs exactly the same to decode
# and wastes none of them.
# 1920x1088 is the ceiling, and it is the decoder's rather than ours. Tried on the real console: 2048x1152,
# 2560x1440 and 3840x2160 never connected at all - no picture, no error, the PS3 simply refused. That is
# exactly where H.264 level 4.2 stops (8704 macroblocks per picture); 1920x1088 needs 8160 and fits, and
# 2048x1152 needs 9216 and does not. cellVdec evidently will not go past 4.2, so the sizes above are gone.
# 1920x1080, not 1088: H.264 codes whole 16x16 blocks, so the encoder pads to 1088 rows by itself
# and marks the extra eight as not-for-display. Asking the capture for 1088 instead meant resampling
# every row of a 1080 desktop to fit - a small stretch, but softer text on every single frame. The
# PS3 app reads the SPS cropping since v1.0.8 and shows the 1080 the encoder meant.

# a slow drift is unavoidable. What DOES differ is how evenly the pictures land on refreshes:

#   60 -> ~1 refresh per picture, even

# Slices per picture - a TEST setting, x264 only, and 1 stays the default because it MEASURED best.
#
# The idea was: cellVdec is handed several SPUs (4, in the console app's decode-h264.c), and a decoder that
# splits its work by slice can only use them if the picture HAS several. It had been tried once before, in
# 1.12.1, and dismissed - but that run was worthless three times over: the slices came from x264's
# sliced-threads on a 24-core machine (~24 of them, not 4), it predates the HRD timing that later halved the
# latency, and the splitter it ran through mis-framed multi-slice streams entirely (479 access units for 120
# pictures - see stream_sender.AnnexBSplitter). So it was re-run properly.
#
# Measured on the real console, 1920x1088, x264, 35 Mbit/s, CAVLC, intra refresh, everything else equal:
#     1 slice   ~29-33 ms latency, 22-30 ms decode   <- best, and the default
#     2 slices  minimally worse
#     4 slices  ~40 ms latency, ~35 ms decode        <- clearly worse
# No change in smoothness at any setting, which was never what slices were about.
#
# So decode cost RISES with the slice count while the bit cost does not (+0.13% at 4 slices, measured): each
# slice costs the decoder a fixed setup and returns nothing. cellVdec does not divide its work by slice.
#
# It rules out SLICE-level parallelism but not, on its own, all of it: a decoder can also split a single slice
# by macroblock row (a wavefront), which would use extra SPUs without needing slices and would be invisible
# here. That was tested separately and the answer is no. The console app was rebuilt with VDEC_SPU_COUNT at 5
# and at 6 (6 is everything it reserves, sys_spu_initialize(6, 0)), each under its own title id so all three
# could be compared back to back on the same console: decode time did not move, and neither did the residual
# unsteadiness. cellVdec therefore does not divide its work at all - the four SPUs are pipeline STAGES, not
# workers, and there is no fifth stage. Sony's sample saying "AVC uses 4 SPUs" is a statement of fact.
#
# So 22-30 ms of decode at 1920x1088 is simply what this decoder costs, and no setting on either side moves
# it. The switch below stays because it is the control group if that ever turns out to be wrong.

# How often a KEYFRAME-mode stream sends an IDR. Not the same concept as the sweep above, though the
# two shared one constant until now.
#
# It matters because of what the PS3 does after a loss: stream.c sets waitingForKeyframe and then
# discards every picture until the next IDR, so this interval IS the worst-case freeze. Measured in a
# 27-second console recording at the old 1 second: five gaps of 117/399/447/466/499 ms, each ending
# exactly on an IDR.
#
# Measured cost of halving it (1920x1088, 60 fps, 41 Mbit/s, real game content, x264 ultrafast):
#   1.0 s -> 41085 kbps, largest access unit 390 KB
#   0.5 s -> 41422 kbps (+0.8 %), largest access unit 389 KB
#   0.25 s -> 42473 kbps (+3.4 %), largest access unit 389 KB
# The burst does NOT grow - rate control caps the IDR - so a shorter interval does not cause more of
# the queue overruns it is meant to recover from. 0.5 s is the conservative step: it halves the freeze
# for under one percent, and only doubles the IDR rate rather than quadrupling what the send pacing
# has to carry.
