"""Child processes that cannot outlive us (port of ChildProcessJob.cs).

Windows had a Job Object: every ffmpeg went in it, and the OS killed them all when the server died -
including the paths that never run our own cleanup (killed in a task manager, hard crash). Otherwise an
orphaned ffmpeg kept holding the screen capture and blocked the next launch.

Linux has no job objects. The equivalent is three layers, cheapest first:
 - PR_SET_PDEATHSIG=SIGKILL in the child (prctl via ctypes in preexec_fn): the kernel kills the child
   the moment its parent is gone, whatever the reason - no cleanup code of ours needs to run.
 - a registry of everything we spawned, so kill_all() can reap on the orderly paths (shutdown, atexit).
 - stdin=DEVNULL by default: a child inheriting the terminal would read the user's keystrokes.

The pdeathsig trap: the signal fires when the THREAD that forked the child exits, not when the process
does (prctl(2)). A pump thread that spawns ffmpeg and then ends while the child should live on would kill
it. So every child is forked from one long-lived spawner thread, which only ends with the process - that
gives the process-lifetime semantics the Job Object had.
