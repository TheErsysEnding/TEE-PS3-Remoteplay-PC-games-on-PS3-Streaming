"""A virtual Xbox 360 controller (port of VirtualGamepad.cs).

Windows had no way for a program to fake a gamepad without the ViGEmBus driver; Linux has uinput built
in, so there is nothing to install. The device carries the real wired 360 pad's name and USB ids, so
SDL, Steam and Proton pick their built-in mapping for it and games see an ordinary controller plugged in.

Axis directions: the PS3 reads y positive downwards, and so does evdev (xpad reports a real 360 pad
that way too), so unlike the XInput report on Windows nothing is inverted here.

open_uinput() lives here because desktop_input.py needs the same guarded UInput (see there).
