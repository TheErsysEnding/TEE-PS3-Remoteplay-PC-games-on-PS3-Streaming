"""Desktop sound for the PS3: capture what the PC plays and send it as small uncompressed packets.

Port of AudioCapture.cs + AudioStreamer.cs. Windows captured the speakers via WASAPI loopback; here
ffmpeg reads the default sink's monitor through the pulse API (PipeWire's pulse server) and pipes raw
s16be stereo to us. Uncompressed on purpose: at 48kHz stereo it costs ~1.5Mbps (a rounding error next
to the video) and skips an encoder here and a decoder on the PS3 - exactly the latency we are trying
not to spend. One packet is 5ms of sound, so a lost packet is a 5ms gap nobody hears.

packet layout (16-byte header, big-endian, must match stream.c on the PS3):
  [0]='A' [1]='F' [2..5]=packetId [6..7]=frameCount [8..15]=capture time (server microseconds)
  payload: frameCount x (left, right) 16-bit signed samples, big-endian
