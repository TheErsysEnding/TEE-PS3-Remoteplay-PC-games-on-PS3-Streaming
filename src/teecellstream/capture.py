"""Screen capture backends: where the desktop picture comes from before ffmpeg encodes it.

Windows had ddagrab inside ffmpeg. Linux has no single equivalent: on Wayland the picture arrives through
xdg-desktop-portal as a PipeWire stream, which the packaged ffmpeg cannot read - so a gst-launch-1.0
subprocess turns it into raw I420 frames on a pipe that ffmpeg reads as rawvideo. On plain X11 ffmpeg's
x11grab reads the screen itself. A videotestsrc backend stands in for the desktop in tests.

The pipe backends hand ffmpeg exactly `fps` pictures a second, on a grid that follows the source (see the
pacing note in feed()): the portal only delivers when something moves, so the source's own rate swings
between 0 and 240 a second, and the console wants one cadence. A picture that is there goes out at once;
a slot with nothing new re-sends the last one, which also keeps the PS3 (2 s without video is "the server
is gone" to it) and the intra-refresh sweep going.

# hair early is not pushed into the next slot, and it is the whole of the jitter feed() adds: writes land in
# [due - WRITE_WINDOW, due], gaps in [T - WRITE_WINDOW, T + WRITE_WINDOW]. It trades the two criteria that
# pull against each other, measured against a source at 42/s (what GNOME's ScreenCast delivers while a game
# runs), 10 s each: 0.15 -> gap stddev 1.87 ms but a new picture ages 5.98 ms; 0.35 -> age 2.45 ms but stddev
# 4.18 ms, a full quarter of the interval. 0.25 is the knee (stddev 3.07 ms, age 4.34 ms), and evenness is

# picture wait most of a slot - and it stays unlucky for hours, because the two clocks agree to a few ppm
# (measured against a 60 Hz source, 6 s: median age 12.57 ms with the servo off, 0.04 ms with it on).
# Correction = gain x (published - the EARLY EDGE of the window), slew-limited per write; see the servo
# paragraph in feed() for why the early edge and not its middle.
SERVO_GAIN = 0.3
# The most one slot may be moved, as a fraction of the interval. It is three things at once: the widest the
# grid's own rate may stray from `fps`, the fastest source rate the grid can still FOLLOW, and how long it
# takes to walk out of a cycle slip (a whole interval of phase, so 1/this many writes).
# It is set to the acceptance bar itself, +-2 pictures a second at 60 fps: anything the grid can follow
# inside that band is a source we may as well follow exactly, and anything outside it we must not.
# This is not a free choice - it is what the REAL portal needs. Measured on this PC's GNOME 50 ScreenCast
# with next to nothing moving on a 1920x1080@240 desktop, 25 s: the source delivers 61.9 pictures a second
# (arrival gaps mean 16.13 ms, sd 1.14), i.e. just OVER our 60, and at 1% the grid tops out at 60.6 and can
# never catch it - the arrival phase then walks through the whole slot every 0.4 s and EVERY picture waits:
#     slew 1%    60.00/s out, gaps sd 0.15 ms, a new picture ages 7.92 ms median / 14.58 p90 / 16.65 max
#     slew 3.3%  62.00/s out, gaps sd 0.03 ms, a new picture ages 1.90 ms median / 2.35 p90 / 2.7 max
# and 496 of 496 pictures went out in the second case against 481 of 496 in the first. Synthetic sources at
# exactly 62/s reproduce both rows. The old 1% was chosen against the rate it caused at a 42/s source
# (60.66/s at 2%); that bias is gone for a different reason - see SERVO_GATE_WRITES - so the slew is free.
# Downwards it stops working: at 0.25% a source running at 60.2/s is no longer tracked (age 3.33 ms
# instead of 0.05), and at 1% one running at 62/s is not (the table above).
# KNOW WHAT THIS BUYS AND WHAT IT COSTS. Following a source's phase inside the band means following its
# RATE: once the grid has locked, the source hands us exactly one picture per slot for ever, so nothing ever
# closes SERVO_GATE_WRITES again and the grid simply runs at the source's rate. Measured, 8 s per source at
# 1280x720: 57/s in -> 60.01/s out, 58 -> 59.85, 59 -> 59.00, 60.1 -> 60.10, 62 -> 62.00, 62.5 -> 60.14,
# 63 and above -> 60.00. So `fps` on the wire is exact only OUTSIDE this band; inside it the wire carries
# the source. On this PC that is 62/s, and the console decodes those two extra pictures a second and then
# throws them away (stream.c nextDrawIndexLocked clamps to publishSeq - 1), and the encoder spends 3.3% more
# than the bitrate it was given per second, because ffmpeg was told -framerate `fps`. It is worth it at
# 61.9/s - 1.9 ms of picture age against 7.9 - but it is a trade, not a free win, and the number to change
# if the console ever needs `fps` kept honest is this one.

# The servo only has a phase to lock while the source hands us EXACTLY one picture per slot. A repeat says
# the source is slower than we are, a superseded picture that it is faster than the grid can follow; neither
# has a phase, and chasing one only drags the rate along. So any write that was not one-for-one closes the
# gate, and this is how many one-for-one writes must pass before the servo is trusted again (0.5 s at 60 fps).
# Both halves are measured, 8 s per source, with the slew at 3.3%:
#   - closing on a repeat is what pays for the wider slew: a 42/s source came out at 60.80/s with only the
#     over-rate half of the gate and at 60.04/s with both (a 5/s source: 60.00/s, gaps sd 1.66 -> 0.91 ms).
#   - closing on a superseded picture is what keeps a fast source at `fps`: 63/s in gave 62.00/s without it
#     and 60.00/s with it, 90/s gave 61.07/s without and 60.00/s with.
# It does not shut the servo out of the case it exists for: a source at 60/s (or 62, or 59.94) delivers one
# picture per slot by definition, so the gate stands open there and the grid locks (age 0.02-0.09 ms).

        # in a terminal produces ~20 pictures a second, a still desktop 10 (pipewiresrc's keepalive), a game
        # 42, mouse movement 60-240; forwarding that verbatim showed on the console as ~20 fps and a stats
        # panel full of red bars, because the PS3 takes one decoded picture per refresh out of a one-frame
        # reserve and repeats the last one whenever it is starved (stream.c, takeFrameForDisplay). ddagrab on
        # Windows duplicated up to a constant 60 and the console app was written against that.
        #
        # What is NOT a repeat of the old fixed clock: the beat came from a free-running grid crossing the
        # source's phase, sending one picture twice and skipping the one between. Neither can happen here.
        #  - `seen` is assigned only in the same breath as the write, so a picture is only ever passed over
        #    because a NEWER one took its place; a repeat goes out only when nothing at all is pending.
        #  - the grid FOLLOWS the source: a picture that had to wait pulls the next grid point towards it (the
        #    servo below), so the phase is held inside the window instead of wandering across it.
        #
        # The window is the slack: a picture that is already there goes out at `due - window` at the earliest,
        # so an arrival a hair early is not pushed into the next slot, and one arriving inside the window goes
        # out the moment it lands. Writes therefore land in [due - window, due] and nowhere else.

        #   The age column is the picture's whole way from the source process's own stamp to ffmpeg's side,
        #   so it carries three crossings of a 1.38 MB frame: about 1.9 ms of it is that traffic and is the
        #   floor here, not the loop. The 0.04-0.05 ms this table used to claim for 5/20/60 is the SAME loop
        #   measured with 64x48 pictures - the size PacingTests uses - and it still reproduces there exactly
        #   (0.05 ms at 20/s and 60/s, 4.60 ms at 42/s, gap stddev 0.02-3.07 ms). Both are true; only one of
        #   them is what the console gets.
        #   The RATE column holds only outside `fps` +- SERVO_SLEW_FRACTION. Inside that band the grid locks
        #   onto the source and carries its rate: measured 59/s in -> 59.00/s out, 60.1 -> 60.10, 62 -> 62.00,
        #   62.5 -> 60.14, 63 and above -> 60.00. See SERVO_SLEW_FRACTION for why, and README/SPEC for what it
        #   means on the wire.
        #   The shipped loop on the same runs: dead 9.9/s (101 ms gaps), 5 -> 10.0, 20 -> 20.0, 42 -> 42.0,
        #   60 -> 60.0, 90 -> 60.0 but with a gap stddev of 4.97 ms (9.5 ms next to 24.7 ms: it writes on
        #   arrival, so two pictures inside one slot go out 10 ms apart), 240 -> 60.0. That is problem (a):
        #   whatever the source does below 60 reaches the console unchanged. Over 30 s every source picture
        #   is accounted for - 42/s: 1303 from the source = 1303 written + 0 superseded; 60/s: 1861 = 1860 +
        #   0, the one left over being the picture published between the last write and stop().
        #   The 42/s row is where the two criteria meet: 4.4 ms of age is the price of gaps that vary by
        #   3.1 ms instead of the source's own 23.8 ms rhythm. WRITE_WINDOW_FRACTION is the knob.
        #
        # Over the rate the OLDEST picture is what is lost, never the newest and never a generation nobody
        # wrote: while the loop sleeps out the rest of a slot the reader keeps replacing `_latest`, and the
        # deadline takes whatever is newest then. The old loop set `seen` BEFORE deciding it was over the
        # rate, so that picture was consumed unwritten and the loop then waited for the NEXT one - measured
        # with a salvo source (5 pictures 4 ms apart, then quiet, i.e. what a window redraw looks like):
        #     shipped:   20.3 writes/s, gap stddev 42.5 ms, longest gap 115.6 ms, picture age p99 110 ms;
        #                527 pictures from the source, 427 to ffmpeg - 100 consumed without being written
        #     this loop: 60.0 writes/s, gap stddev 1.51 ms, longest gap 20.9 ms, age p99 10.6 ms;
        #                527 from the source = 317 written + 209 superseded by a newer one, none swallowed
        #
        # The repeats keep running at the full rate for as long as the stream lasts - no backing off after N
        # still seconds, although each one costs the console a decode. Three reasons, in order of weight:
        # the intra-refresh sweep is counted in PICTURES (-g = fps, and the recovery_point SEI was measured
        # landing every 60 of them whatever the input rate), so at 10 repeats a second the self-repair after
        # a lost packet takes 6 s instead of 1 - on a STILL desktop, which is exactly where nothing else will
        # ever overwrite the damage; a back-off is itself a rate change, and a changing rate is the whole
        # complaint this loop exists to answer, with the worst possible moment being the first mouse movement
        # after the idle; and with intra refresh an unchanged picture is a refresh strip plus skip macroblocks,
        # so it is cheap in the only currency the console counts, bits. ddagrab on Windows sent 60 always.
        #
        # What the loop itself costs: against a source producing 321000 pictures a second it wrote its 300 in
        # 5 s at a gap stddev of 0.05 ms and burned 0.028 s of its own thread CPU - it waits, it never spins,
        # because with a picture in hand it sleeps on the stop Event where the reader cannot reach it. Ten
        # start/stop cycles through the real gst pipeline: fds 5 -> 5, threads 2 -> 2, no child left behind,
        # 60.0 writes a second in every one of them.
