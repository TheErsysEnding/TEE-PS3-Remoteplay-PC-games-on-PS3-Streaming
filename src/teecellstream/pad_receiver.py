"""Receives the PS3's controller and replays it on the PC (port of PadReceiver.cs).

Either as a virtual Xbox gamepad (for games) or as the pointer and keyboard (for the desktop); the PS3
picks which with a PADMODE message. The gamepad needs a writable /dev/uinput (the package's udev rule
grants it), and we fall back to the mouse without it.

pad packet layout (20 bytes, big-endian, must match stream.c on the PS3):
  [0]='C' [1]='P' [2..5]=packetId [6..7]=buttons [8]=leftX [9]=leftY [10]=rightX [11]=rightY
  [12..19]=send time, already converted to OUR clock by the PS3

handle() runs on the server's receive thread outside any try - so nothing in here may raise, whatever
the packet looks like.
