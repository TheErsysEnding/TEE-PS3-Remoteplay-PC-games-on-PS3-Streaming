"""Where the discovery beacon goes (port of Server.GetBeaconTargets).

The machine can have several network adapters (libvirt and VirtualBox add virtual ones), and a plain
255.255.255.255 broadcast only leaves through ONE of them - often the wrong one. So the beacon goes to
every adapter's own broadcast address (e.g. 192.0.2.255) plus the global one.

Linux is asked through `ip -j addr`, Windows through the IP Helper API (see netinfo_windows).
