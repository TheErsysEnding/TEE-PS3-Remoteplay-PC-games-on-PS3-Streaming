"""XMB artwork for "TEE Remote Play" - SHARP ANGULAR concept, blue.

Renders the two files the PS3 asks for:
  ICON0.PNG   320x176  - the tile in the XMB game column
  PIC1.PNG   1920x1080 - the full-screen background shown while that tile is selected

Both are looked at on a TELEVISION from two or three metres. That drives every decision here:
nothing thinner than roughly 5 px survives the console's scaler plus the set's sharpening, so the
mark is built from plates, not from lines.

Three things differ from tools/make-branding.py, and each of them is the point of this file:

1. BLUE, not orange. The author's other PS3 app ("TEE VANCED") already owns orange-on-black. The
   ground stays dark for the same reason it was dark before - the XMB draws its own white title
   over PIC1, and a bright background makes that title unreadable.

2. PIC1 keeps out of the XMB's own chrome. Measured off a photo of the real console, the XMB and
   the user's CFW paint over most of the frame; the previous design put the wordmark straight
   underneath the white app title. FORBIDDEN and PRIMARY below are those measurements, and the
   script asserts against them at render time rather than trusting the eye.

3. Sharp angular styling: 45-degree clipped corners instead of rounded ones, and ONE diagonal -
   a saturated blue blade that sweeps up behind the mark and stops, cut off square to its own
   axis, just short of the wordmark. Every edge in the piece is at 0, 45 or 90 degrees; the only
   curves left are the broadcast arcs, which mean something.

   Note what the blade CANNOT do: a 45-degree band and a tall left-aligned text block cannot be
   separated by a straight cut at any angle, because over the height of the block the band slides
   sideways by that same height and walks into the letters. The mark therefore sits ON the blade
   and the type sits clear of it, and the blade's reach is bounded by geometry - see blade().
